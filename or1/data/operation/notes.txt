OPERATION VOLTAGE TEST
VIO = constant 3.3V

Running at 12.5 MHz

Single port test protocol:
* Set Vcore = test voltage
* Fill memory with test pattern on port 0
* Wait 50 ms
* Read back on port 0

Dual port test protocol:
* Set Vcore = test voltage
* Fill memory with test pattern on port 0
* Wait 50 ms
* Read back on port 0 and 1 simultaneously (reading each address on both ports at once)

Repeat test from 1800 to 1000 mV
Same thermal conditions as retention test
