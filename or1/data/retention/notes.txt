RETENTION TEST
VIO = constant 3.3V

Running at 12.5 MHz

Test protocol:
* Set Vcore = 1.8V
* Wait 10 ms
* Fill memory with test pattern on port 0
* Reduce Vcore to test voltage
* Wait 10 seconds
* Bring Vcore back up to 1.8V
* Wait 10 ms
* Read results back on port 0

Repeat test from 500 to 10 mV

Two stage Peltier heat pump mounted to top side of die. Arctic Silver 5 TIM. Held in place by mass of heat sink
(Dynatron x86 CPU cooler).

Chilled: (2.6A)
* Coldest point of Peltier touching chip measures -0.2C via FLIR
* Top of PCB near chip measures 14.8C via FLIR
* Bottom of PCB directly under chip measures 12.0C via PT100 RTD

Ambient
* Heat pump inactive
* PCB temperature measures 23.9C via PT100 RTD

Heated (2.7A)
* Hottest part of Peltier touching chip measures 86.6C via FLIR
* Top of PCB near chip measures 57.4C via FLIR
* Bottom of PCB directly under chip measures 55.7C via PT100 RTD
